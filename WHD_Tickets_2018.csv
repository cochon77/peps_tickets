I'm sure we can make something work, but it probably won't be a TV. Reason being is we used to have 42"" LG TVs that were easy to transport, but not anymore. We very recently purchased new 60"" TVs which is great, but still setting them up. In theory, those are designated specifically for _presentation_ support anyway, but mostly we're not yet prepared for hauling.My other question is I think the East Wing has at least one TV mounted on the wall doesn't it? Is it viable to use that, or does that not serve the area you're hoping to have the party in? We certainly have plenty of projectors and setting up a table top screen with a player would be easy.

I apologize for the delay while I was wading through Trustee weekend. I do have a few questions.Do you know how many people are attending? The AGH Library is not a space that we typically will set with a projector. With so many spaces on campus that already have ready-to-go systems, it just doesn't make sense. Is it possible to have this portion of the workshop in the AGH Meeting Room, for instance? Or perhaps you can shed some light on the matter for me. It's also worth thinking about sound. We have several CAMS classrooms with great sound systems for watching movies, while a projector by itself will not sound good. I realize that may not be the focus here, but some food for thought anyway.

The rooms we have reserved are WCC 236 as the main space, and three potential break out rooms: 1. WCC 230, 2. WCC 231, 3. WCC 233. This means that the portable screen and projection setup for Great Hall is no longer necessary. If possible, I'd like to have three wireless lapel microphones in WCC 236, but if only two are possible, we can keep one speaker at the podium mic. I'd also like to have someone present for the start, just to ensure a clean hand off to our guest speakers. Here's a link to the conference page (at the moment it still says Sayles-Hill/Great Hall). https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-upper-midwest-higher-education-group-presents-winter-meeting-upper-midwest-higher-education-group#/ I anticipate they will update the location info after our meeting tomorrow.I hope this makes equipment and logistics more simple being closer to PEPS.

We do it often enough though, I think because there aren't many spaces on campus that fit so many people. Lucky for us (or not) this time of year the overcast skies help our projection. My tendency is to set the screen on the East side against the windows. It often allows more room for our equipment and is close to power. I'm open to other orientation ideas though.Questions/confirmations for you: I see the banquet starts at 2pm, is that when the video/slide show will start too? Do you need a microphone for anything? You're planning on using your own computer? Let me know what other questions you have. Feel free to call me directly if that's easier.  Thanks,  Matt (x7012)</note><note date=""10/24/18 9:27 am"" author=""mburr"" type=""hidden"" time=""0"" rate="""">*Strike Ticket 98633 [ https://helpdesk.carleton.edu/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa/wa/TicketActions/view?ticket=98633 ].*</note>"

There's no reason that you need the lectern, it's simply a personal choice about how you want the event to flow.

In the boxes labeled ""Event Start"" and ""Event End"" we want the time the actual shindig officially begins and concludes. We need that for scheduling. So if it's a formal presentation, it's the time speaking starts and the audience is paying attention. For a dinner function it's a bit more nebulous, but probably it's what time the guests are expected to be checked in and seated by. Once an event is supposed to start our techs should be just about gone.

We should be good. We're getting all those power strips set up on Friday, and will have a tech available on Monday like we discussed. One thing that would be great if you could pass along, is to have them turn the mic on when they need it, and then turn back off when they're done. It has a large easy switch right on the front. The batteries have a good long life, but always a good idea to conserve. We'll leave a remote on the projector so it can also be easily turned on/off.I think I just have 1 question left.

Your specific task for this portion is in relation to #2. We'll have a bucket of power strips on loan from the Help Desk here in PEPS. I'll leave them on my desk. They're using laptops all day throughout the conference, so they need power run to each table.The most important thing here is to run power as directly as possible in clean, straight lines, and tape the whole thing down to the floor. There are fresh rolls of tape in the Great Hall. In addition, they will need a projection and screen setup. There's a lot of work to be done! I'm assigning Jennifer to help out too.

It would be preferable if the devices were discreet enough to be mounted behind or to the side of the cases.

If you come out of this with a healthy appreciation for that _and _a great performance then all the better.The Dance Studio is busier than I realized so I'm still trying to see if we can get in there Friday.

I'll be in touch.  Thanks,  Matt</note><note date=""4/7/18 11:21 am"" author=""leeb2"" type=""client"">Hey Matt,Are there no wireless mics available? We've only used wireless mics, I'm not too sure about the quality of wired mics for vocals. Also, I'm concerned that there would be too many wires going across the stage. Our performance is simply a 10-15 minute intermission, between a bunch of dances. I'm afraid that wired mics could cause a lot of traffic across the stage. My plan is to have everything to the side during the dances so that they can use the dance floor, and then set our amps center stage during intermission for our performance, and move things back to the side for the second half so that people can dance. I don't know if wired mics would give us the flexibility and mobility needed. I was hoping for wireless mics, since the console doesn't need to be connected to the mic. We could set up the PA console at the center of the seats (bleachers) or the second floor, and set up the speaker on the left/right sides of the stage so that we don't have wires from mics running through the stage, which might interfere with people dancing. We would have more flexibility in locating the console if we use wireless mics.There are no staging platforms set. The studio will be as is. Also, I just wanted to clarify, could PEPS provide us with power strips and extension cords so that we can get cables going from the power outlets from the left/right side of the stage? I've carefully looked around the studio myself, and there are power outlets on the walls on the left/right. We would need some power strips to reach center stage, so that our amps would be conveniently placed center stage as well. I wasn't sure what you meant by ""long cables"".I can meet with someone Friday afternoon to set things up. I am free between 2~5 PM. Let me know what time would work.Sincerely,Bonny</note><note date=""4/13/18 4:23 pm"" author=""mburr"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate="""">Hi Bonny,No worries - I'll put 2 at the mixer table in the mezzanine.

Bonny (our client) has a friend who is going to man the mic levels during the performance. Also the bleachers come out pretty far, and where we were planning to have the gear turned out to be in the way. _That takes us to our new and improved audio setup 2.0_. *All the gear is in the mezzanine and plugged in (see pics)*. You'll just need to turn everything on and check levels with them like we talked about. Mics are stowed in the black case. I'd suggest getting some white tape and labeling them 1,2,3 (I ran out of time).When you're tearing down - if it's not clear what cables go with what case just leave it on my desk and I'll sort it out.  Thanks again,  Matt</note><note date=""4/9/18 4:08 pm"" author=""mburr"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate="""">Hi Bonny,Thanks for your thoughtful reply. You make a good point about the transition process and the potential mess of a wired system. This type of planning is a good reason to involve PEPS early. Earlier is always better!I apologize for being unclear and for the back-and-forth novels! I was referring to microphone cables of which we mainly have 25 foot cables - not particularly long. We do have a few wireless systems, but we don't check them out through the ECC. If a wireless is used in a setup it is required that a tech be available to pick it up that night. As an aside, the fact that it's wired or wireless has no bearing on microphone quality.Lastly, we definitely have power for you. We have power cable reels, with 4 outlets each and then you can plug in power strips as needed. So where does that leave us?

We would send students to the Great Hall with the equipment and they'd perform the set up. You would still need to provide someone to take photos. We can't provide photography services because we can't promise consistent results. ""Booth"" is also a loose term. What we have is a backdrop that's supported by 2 stands.

At the event, we will have speakers perform poems (either one speaker or bigger groups). Last year, we had a solo mic and it didn’t work so well because sometimes, single speakers didn’t remember to put it close to their mouth and groups had a hard time gathering around one solo mic. So I was thinking that a choir mic would work much better and pick up the performers without them having to think about the technology. I also think that acoustically, a choir mic will work better in the Athenaeum, because it won’t be amplifying the performers too much, just give them a little bit more oompf.I checked out the lighting situation as well, and the overheads don’t do their job well when all other lights are off. The goal is to have the group/ single performers in light, the audience in the dark.Let me know what you think about my ideas.Thanks,Juliane---Juliane Schicker, PhDAssistant Professor of GermanCarleton CollegeSign up for Office Hours herewww.juliane-schicker.de---I'll tell you what people look like, really: they look like flames.

You can only help a performer so much who doesn't use the tools you give them! Especially in a space like the Atheneum that isn't designed as a performance venue per se. Maybe the answer is to use the solo mic, but work on adjusting the volume if it feels generally too strong. Or we can bring a separate speaker to bypass the installed system entirely and then you'd have a physical volume knob. It could be set in the back of the room - the theory being that the front will hear just fine, and you can fill in sound for the back where it's harder to hear, and is close for control.I'm afraid we don't have any director lamps in PEPS, so we'll have to figure that out.

Having the department chair shout was notworking very well. Fortunately, one of the Catering staff figured out howto turn it on or up at the control box in the corner of Great Hall. Then,when I started the Powerpoint, the slides were moving but there was nomusic, so I ran over to the wall control box and turned several dials upuntil the music came on. All of this was disruptive and embarrassing infront of a room full of people, including President Poskanzer.Something like this always happens in Great Hall.

A few notes to pass along to the performers:-The speakers are backed up against the wall, but there is a lot of slack in the cords and they are not heavy, so they could be moved. Same goes for the mic as far as being able to move it.-The mic is in channel 1; remember to turn up both the channel volume and the master; both at half is probably a good place to start.-Since the mic is in front of the speakers, it might cause some feedback if the channel volume goes above about halfway. That should be loud enough, but just be careful not to point it directly at a speaker.Tuomas</note><note date=""2/21/18 3:50 pm"" author=""mburr"" type=""tech"" time=""0"" rate="""">Hey, Holly!I've got this and the next one scheduled with a tech.

For one thing, Facilities didn't show up with the requested tables or chairs or lectern, despite the client having received confirmation that they would be there. After trying and failing to reach Facilities myself, the client and I ended up (at her suggestion) borrowing a few tables from neighboring rooms, which we set up while the poets were arriving.Furthermore, two of the four mics were not picking up audio very well at all, leaving me to have to try and adjust their levels from the teaching station and from the recievers behind the curtains. This was despite the fact that they were all working fine when I checked them before the event.All that aside, the event itself went over quite well, tech and Facilities problems notwithstanding.

We could also think about running the cable along the wall, tape it down but leave enough service cable to the lectern when facilities needs to remove the lectern from the room?
